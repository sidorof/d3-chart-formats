# d3-chart-formats

This project enables a way of exploring the selection of parameters for D3.js charts. D3 is an amazing package, you can do anything with it. However, that means  that decisions need to be made as to an overall look or aesthetic as well as more detail specifications for how a particular chart should look.

To that end, I have created some classes and functions to make the charts and implemented a minor build using Vue.js and Vuetify.js to play with parameters.

This is in early stages.
